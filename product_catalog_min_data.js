Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.5) Loan - Take a \u00c2\u00a330 loan and reduce your income.Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.New 'Sell' systemBrewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also 'grease the wheels of industry' by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.Birmingham features three all-new industry types:Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to \u00c2\u00a38 per cube, and it's not uncommon.Brass: Birmingham is a finely brewed sequel to one of history's most industrial economic games. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor. Many of the tried and true strategies of the original are no longer as powerful as they once were, and other interesting new strategies are waiting for you to discover.","images":{"main":"http://images.salsify.com/image/upload/s--b-3XFNot--/e5e0370f94a3aa68a3938e9fdaa1ce27f6ec85d1.webp","front":"http://images.salsify.com/image/upload/s--nto2Zqp3--/298a7a5afabf7c21f6f832cf7dcca1ef8e5ab4fd.jpg","angle":null,"pack":"http://images.salsify.com/image/upload/s--RpDi_4Sg--/4e50a01d86fe29f4eebb74a325bc724f4f7f56a7.jpg"},"primaryImage":"http://images.salsify.com/image/upload/s--b-3XFNot--/e5e0370f94a3aa68a3938e9fdaa1ce27f6ec85d1.webp","minQty":1,"caseQty":6,"inStock":true,"featured":true},{"id":"ONKDP","sku":"ONKDP","title":"DroPolter","price":12.19,"msrp":23.0,"margin":47.0,"category":"Family Games","publisher":"Oink Games","upc":"4571394093221","players":{"min":2,"max":5},"ageMin":6,"description":"Quickly drop ONLY the necessary lucky charms in this palm coordination game!","images":{"main":"http://images.salsify.com/image/upload/s--j_g2tsk---/7bd8b732ac02a277a2a0b74e21eac676709db3f3.png","front":"http://images.salsify.com/image/upload/s--j_g2tsk---/7bd8b732ac02a277a2a0b74e21eac676709db3f3.png","angle":"http://images.salsify.com/image/upload/s--aEOBmyp7--/0638ecff8bcb217d59f6d59c53f3b8db271535df.png","pack":null},"primaryImage":"http://images.salsify.com/image/upload/s--j_g2tsk---/7bd8b732ac02a277a2a0b74e21eac676709db3f3.png","minQty":1,"caseQty":6,"inStock":true,"featured":true},{"id":"ONKAFA","sku":"ONKAFA","title":"Fake Artist Goes to New York","price":12.19,"msrp":23.0,"margin":47.0,"category":"Strategy Games","publisher":"Oink Games","upc":"4571394090589","players":{"min":5,"max":10},"ageMin":8,"description":"Everyone is drawing one picture together...but one doesn't know what everyone is drawing.

If the hands point in the same direction, they've won maximum points.","images":{"main":"http://images.salsify.com/image/upload/s--LcsRsj1k--/s23hpiijhn8bsxhr8uka.jpg","front":null,"angle":null,"pack":"http://images.salsify.com/image/upload/s--LcsRsj1k--/s23hpiijhn8bsxhr8uka.jpg"},"primaryImage":"http://images.salsify.com/image/upload/s--LcsRsj1k--/s23hpiijhn8bsxhr8uka.jpg","minQty":1,"caseQty":6,"inStock":true,"featured":false},{"id":"IBCAVA1","sku":"IBCAVA1","title":"Resistance Avalon","price":13.2447,"msrp":24.99,"margin":47.0,"category":"Party Games","publisher":"Indie Boards & Cards","upc":"722301926192","players":{"min":5,"max":10},"ageMin":null,"description":"Step into the legendary world of Arthurian lore with The Resistance: Avalon, where strategy, deception, and social deduction meet in an exhilarating tabletop experience.

Kill everything you meet. Backstab your friends and steal their stuff. Grab the treasure and run. Admit it. You love it. This award-winning card game, designed by Steve Jackson, captures the essence of the dungeon experience . . . with none of that stupid roleplaying stuff. You and your friends compete to kill monsters and grab magic items. And what magic items! Don the Horny Helmet and the Boots of Butt-Kicking. Wield the Staff of Napalm . . . or maybe the Chainsaw of Bloody Dismemberment. Start by slaughtering the Potted Plant and the Drooling Slime, and work your way up to the Plutonium Dragon . . . And it's illustrated by John Kovalic! Fast-playing and silly, Munchkin can reduce any roleplaying group to hysteria. And, while they're laughing, you can steal their stuff. Munchkin is a stand-alone card game designed by Steve Jackson that simulates (well, sorta') a fantasy-themed RPG (oh, ok, DnD) in a simple, card-based game that's chock full o' silliness. Everyone begins the game as a 1st level Human with NO Class (heh-heh) and via cards, they acquire Races (Elf, Dwarf, etc.), Classes (Thief, Wizard, Cleric, etc.), Items, Armor, Potions and more that they use to combat hideous monsters like the 4th level Undead Horse, the 10th level Net Troll and the 14th Level Unspeakably Awful, Indescribable Horror (very nasty, indeed). The object of the game is to reach Level 10 and levels are acquired via the slaying of monsters and the selling of acquired treasure (1,000 Gold Pieces equals 1 Level). Very silly and a lot of fun!

It mixes hand-building and tactical card play with deduction and tenuous cooperation.On the dark film-noir roads of mob-ruled Mantis Falls in the 1940s, you are witnesses hunted for your information. You now must survive the night and escape town alive. Working together, you will need to frequently cooperate and trust one another to navigate the night, but things may not all be as they seem. Each game may be entirely witnesses - meaning players can only win by all surviving together - or there could secretly be an assassin hidden among you, subtly manipulating the situation and waiting for the right moment to strike.You'll make concealed moves and develop hidden plans, but also need to have thorough conversations throughout as you discuss tactics, defend choices and bluff to protect carefully guarded secrets. In your slow walk, you will seek allies, acquire tools and become encumbered by grave afflictions. The steps forward present secret 'unseen' events and double-edged action cards, which stir confusion and degrade confidence. As the night wears, witnesses and assassins alike will need to tread the line between the value of teamwork and a preparation to kill.Mantis Falls creates a unique and tense game experience, meant to draw you into the characters' horrifying night and make you feel the profound power, and danger, that can come from our ability to trust. Like life, Mantis Falls is a cooperative game that is only really cooperative sometimes.","images":{"main":"http://images.salsify.com/image/upload/s--rOq2z4bS--/c6fff4b1829f41546a65f901b6d2e5b1898acd65.jpg","front":"http://images.salsify.com/image/upload/s--T1rdpUBy--/80c135066ed49715aec301cc27fa993b943a1fd4.png","angle":null,"pack":"http://images.salsify.com/image/upload/s--nnWmg08---/da216549d9dcc8d8434a26157f6f57c1051e4cbc.png"},"primaryImage":"http://images.salsify.com/image/upload/s--rOq2z4bS--/c6fff4b1829f41546a65f901b6d2e5b1898acd65.jpg","minQty":1,"caseQty":6,"inStock":true,"featured":false},{"id":"1AWAW03ASX","sku":"1AWAW03ASX","title":"Air Land & Sea Spies Lies & Supplies","price":10.5947,"msrp":19.99,"margin":47.0,"category":"Strategy Games","publisher":"Arcane Wonders","upc":"853211004912","players":{"min":2,"max":2},"ageMin":14,"description":"In the midst of the greatest conflict humanity has ever known, victory will be claimed by the military that can overcome their enemies in every battleground.
